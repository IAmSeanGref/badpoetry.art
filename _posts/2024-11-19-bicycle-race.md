title: Bicycle Race
---

I want to win a cycle race  
On bikes with lots of gears,  
But workouts they all bore to tears  
And travel still's a chore.

If I could magically compete  
With neither time nor pain  
I'd win the tour de france again  
And win again some more.

So this is not reality  
And I can not win free  
Of effort nor of consequence.  
It's laziness for me.
