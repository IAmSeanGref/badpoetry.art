title: The Grimbletark
---

There once were creatures large as mice  
With claws and fangs but oh so nice  
The grimbletark was oft' confused  
With rodents which most folks refused  
But grimbletarks they are so good  
To people who will bring them food  
For once or twice a grimbletark  
Stared deep into men's souls of dark  
And saw the truth upon a field  
Of stars and down on knees they kneeled  
To beg of mercy from who's mean.  
Potatoes they brought out, and cream  
A feast was had in aether-space  
Stuffed bellies and a dirty face  
Was all that's left of grimbletarks  
Now they've been ate. Extincted. Larks.
