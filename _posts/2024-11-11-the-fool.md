title: The Fool
---

At once, I got along with him, the fool  
A fool was I when younger years did show  
This man and his forgotten lover's rule  
I broke the rule and then he came to know  

We tread the waters equally in share  
But dignity we simply couldn't spare  
For in these matters that pertain to love  
Just one above, you see, just one above.
