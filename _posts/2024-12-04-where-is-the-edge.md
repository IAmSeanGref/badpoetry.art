title: Where Is The Edge?
---

I get it.  
The flat earthers, I mean.  
Well, sort of.  

The idea that  
There's a finite boundary.  
That this is all there is.  
That our knowable world is  
Contained in a comprehensible scope.

The idea that  
Nothing else out there  
Is important  
Beyond the ice wall.

The idea that  
It's all as it looks.

I get it.  
It's comfort.  
It's ego.  
It's...  

Sometimes I wonder,  
Where is the edge?  
Where does this consciousness  
Have a boundary?  
Clearly it does not have  
Infinite permeability.  

Or does it?

Perhaps it is I  
Who simply doesn't want  
To believe in the spherical  
Nature of my own existence.  
That I contain all that I am  
And that I am actually limitless.  

Perhaps it is I  
Who cannot accept reality  
That whatever I do or don't  
Accomplish is not because of  
Some impassable ice wall but  
My own self imposed restrictions.

Perhaps it is I  
Who is the dumby.

How do I test that flat earth theory?  
Is it that I must circumnavigate my own Earth?
