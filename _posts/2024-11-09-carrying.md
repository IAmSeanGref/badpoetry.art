title: Carrying
---

On a warm, summer day  
With soft, light clouds  
Hanging blissfully upon  
A gently pale blue sky,  
I walk the rocky trail  
With dog in tow and  
Burdens upon my shoulders.  
Today is but another  
Day to have a journey  
Where meaning comes from  
All the thoughts that  
Flicker and float through  
My whirlpool of a mind.

I call the dog's name  
To hasten his step.  
The light still shines  
In his clouded eyes  
And his tail wistfully  
Wags, back and forth,  
But joints which take  
More energy to move  
Than years before slow  
Movement, but not his spirit.  
He questions naught  
And follows well  
But steps soon falter and stop.  
Laying down in earth  
He pants to catch his breath.  

His weight is limp upon my arms  
The fur still soft and glossy  
His breathing slow and labored, yet  
This burden brings me comfort  
The car we reach not far from here  
And in the back he settles  
We stop to get a tasty meal  
And suddenly  
I wake up.  

I dont have a male dog.  
It was all a dream.
