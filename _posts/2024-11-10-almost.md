title: Almost
---

This venture is almost finished  
The quest is almost done  
But now his good name is tarnished  
Tis sad what he's become

Awake with a free'ed spirit  
He sees a newer path
But twere he to try and walk it  
He would succumb to wrath

It isn't so easy always  
As many are to say  
But if you work all your days
You'll have tried.
