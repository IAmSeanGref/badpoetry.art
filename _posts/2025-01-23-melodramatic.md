title: Melodramatic
---

At times I wish I could be just like you  
Who does not care what repurcuasions sow  
From actions taken that make me feel good  
As public image of me does not grow 

And melo-o-dramatic I may feel  
I have no confidence nor want so real  
To publicly expose my inner self  
So all my feelings lay upon a shelf

Peruse if you so choose to look around  
At all my feelings there not on display  
For these are what I dare not yet express  
But brewing still are thoughts I dare not say.
