title: Bears Aren't All Bad
---

Bears aren't all bad.  
Some may maul severely  
But that's the baddies.  
And many more aren't  
So threatening to strangers

Friendly bears become friends  
When friends feed willingly  
For hands honey-fied find  
Tongues licked, lacking teething.  
Empty hands herald eating  
Either way, which explains  
Why people protest whenever  
A bear becomes admonished  
Suddenly by bullets shot  
From rangers' rifles freely.  

It becomes better if  
Bears left living by  
Their own original traits  
Of nature, not of  
Human desire. Don't hunt  
Or interact, if opportunities  
Present themselves to pet  
Curious bears. Be cautious.
