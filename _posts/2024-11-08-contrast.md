title: Contrast

A weeping willow wilts  
With wind through sun-soaked leaves  
While a pigeon shits  
On corporately dressed businessmen

The pitter patter protests  
A hundred needles on street bricks  
Rejecting the sunny,  
Cloudy morning

I watch in wonder  
As people walk briskly  
Through alleys  
To eat at an overpriced cafe
