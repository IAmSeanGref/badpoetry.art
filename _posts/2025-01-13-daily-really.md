title: Daily, Really?
---

If there's a goal you think you'll hit this year  
But once per day becomes success you say  
Then think perhaps if daily is so right  
Since daily goals are hard to nail down tight

Instead you may find outcomes based in weeks  
And partials of them doth your mind then seeks  
Do not let limits in success prevent  
The progress of your character contend  
Lamentable offense is naught but this:  
To fail and stop.
